# OpenAI Fine-Tunes Simple UI

![image](public/screenshot.jfif)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple, minimal UI for the [OpenAI fine-tunes API.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes)

You should run the app locally - you'll need your API key for this and entering it onto a hosted site isn't secure.

Make sure you've [set up billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview) and have an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) created.

## Functionality
 - [x] list fine-tuned models
 - [x] view events of each fine-tuned model
 - [ ] create a new fine-tuned model
 - [x] delete a fine-tuned model

## Running the UI

### `npm install`
To install packages

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
